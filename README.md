# IntroToReact
Women In Tech Allies Meetup Notes

I really want to thank everyone who came to this workshop.  It was a pleasure meeting all of you and I hope you were able to get a lot out of it.  Please feel free to ask me questions about this material or just code in general. 

I have uploaded the project(s) to this github for everyone. https://github.com/susanwands/IntroToReact

The Drinkly file contains the application that I worked on to prepare for the workshop.  While we were not able to accomplish all of it during the talk, we did cover a lot of the concepts.  Maybe you can try to finish the project with this as your guide.  Or add new features to it...

The Siply file is what we actually covered in the workshop.  Very much a "work in progress".  

A few extra resources to let you know about...

For Drinkly:
  - I pulled down the picture from Pexel (free) o	https://www.pexels.com
  - I used Bootstrap to make the styling a little easier o	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
  - I used fonts from Google (free) o	https://fonts.google.com/
  - Our data is pulling from o	http://www.thecocktaildb.com/
  
Some resources for learning more:
  - Facebook actually has solid and easy to follow documentation and starter tutorials
    •	https://facebook.github.io/react/
  •	LearnCode Academy : React JS Tutorials (youtube) - I really liked the first 5 or 6 of these for an introduction
    o	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhkGQAoc7bc&list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b
  •	Pluralsite has a React Path with progressive lessons - the intro lesson was very good for this.
